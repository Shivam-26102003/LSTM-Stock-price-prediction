## Overview

**Stock Price Prediction using LSTM** applies a recurrent neural network architecture specifically tailored for time series forecasting. By learning patterns in sequential data, LSTMs excel at capturing long-term dependencies, making them well-suited for stock price movement predictions.

This project is ideal for:
- Students and enthusiasts exploring **deep learning** for financial analytics.
- Data scientists aiming to understand **time series forecasting** with neural networks.
- Anyone interested in creating reproducible experiments using **Python** and **TensorFlow**.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Automatically handles missing values, normalizes data, and transforms it into the right shape for LSTM models.

- **Flexible LSTM Model**  
  An easily customizable Keras/TensorFlow LSTM architecture to fine-tune hyperparameters like the number of layers, neurons, and dropout.

- **Visualization**  
  Interactive plots to analyze stock trends, model training, and predicted vs. actual results.

- **Performance Metrics**  
  Evaluate your modelâ€™s accuracy using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
